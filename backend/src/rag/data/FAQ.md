# Dogs (Canis lupus familiaris)

### Core Care

**Q: When should my puppy get vaccines?**  
A: Start at 6–8 weeks, then every 3–4 weeks until at least 16 weeks. Core shots are distemper, adenovirus, parvo, and rabies. Boosters are usually yearly or every three years, depending on local rules and vaccine type.

**Q: How often do dogs need deworming?**  
A: Puppies every 2 weeks until 12 weeks old, then monthly until 6 months. Adults: at least every 3–6 months or as advised after a stool test.

**Q: What flea and tick prevention works best?**  
A: Choose from spot‑ons, oral tablets, or collars. The “best” is the one your vet confirms is safe for your dog’s age and health and that you can give on time every month.

### Nutrition

**Q: How much should I feed my dog?**  
A: Check the kibble chart for weight and adjust if your dog gains or loses body condition. A good rule is ribs covered but easy to feel, waist visible from above.

**Q: Can dogs eat bones?**  
A: Only raw, meaty bones that are too large to swallow and only under supervision. Never give cooked bones—they splinter.

**Q: Are grain‑free diets healthier?**  
A: Not automatically. Some grain‑free formulas are linked with heart disease in certain breeds. Ask your vet before switching.

### Grooming & Hygiene

**Q: How often should I bathe my dog?**  
A: Most dogs need a bath every 4–6 weeks. Over‑bathing can dry skin unless your vet prescribes medicated shampoos.

**Q: Do I need to brush my dog’s teeth?**  
A: Yes, ideally daily. Dental chews help, but brushing is the gold standard to prevent tartar and gum disease.

### Behavior & Training

**Q: When can I start training a puppy?**  
A: Right away. Even eight‑week‑old pups can learn sit, come, and crate routines using positive rewards.

**Q: How do I stop my dog from pulling on walks?**  
A: Use a front‑clip harness and reward the dog for walking by your side. Stop moving when the leash tightens, resume when slack returns.

### Common Illnesses

**Q: What are early signs of kennel cough?**  
A: A dry, honking cough, sometimes with a runny nose but no fever. See a vet if coughing lasts more than a few days.

**Q: My dog is limping—should I see a vet right away?**  
A: Yes if the limp is sudden, severe, or your dog won’t bear weight. Mild limps that improve in 24 hours can be monitored.

### Senior Dog Care

**Q: At what age is my dog considered senior?**  
A: Small breeds: ~8–10 years, large/giant breeds: ~6–7 years.

**Q: How often should senior dogs have check‑ups?**  
A: Twice a year for full exams, bloodwork, and dental checks help catch issues early.

### First‑Aid Basics

**Q: What should be in a dog first‑aid kit?**  
A: Gauze, adhesive tape, non‑stick pads, digital thermometer (°C), tick remover, saline, blunt‑tip scissors, and vet contact info.

# Cats (Felis catus)

### Core Care

**Q: Do indoor cats need vaccines?**  
A: Yes. Core vaccines—panleukopenia, calicivirus, herpesvirus, and rabies—protect even strictly indoor cats.

**Q: How often should I treat my cat for worms and fleas?**  
A: Monthly spot‑on or oral preventives keep most parasites away. Indoor cats can still get fleas via people or other pets.

### Nutrition

**Q: Wet vs. dry food—what’s better?**  
A: Wet food aids hydration and weight control; dry food can help dental health. Many vets recommend a mix.

**Q: How do I prevent obesity?**  
A: Use a kitchen scale, feed by calorie need (usually 30–35 kcal/kg ideal weight per day), and play 10+ minutes twice daily.

### Grooming & Hygiene

**Q: Do cats need baths?**  
A: Usually no. Short‑haired cats self‑clean. Long‑haired breeds may need occasional baths and daily brushing to avoid mats.

**Q: How often should I trim my cat’s nails?**  
A: Every 2–4 weeks. Start young so your cat gets used to paw handling.

### Behavior

**Q: Why does my cat scratch furniture?**  
A: Scratching sheds nail sheaths and marks territory. Provide sturdy scratching posts and reward use.

**Q: How can I reduce spraying?**  
A: Neuter before sexual maturity, keep litter boxes clean, and reduce stress with separate resources for each cat.

### Common Illnesses

**Q: What are signs of urinary blockage?**  
A: Frequent trips to the litter box with little urine, yowling, or licking the genital area. This is an emergency—see a vet now.

**Q: My cat vomits hairballs often—is this normal?**  
A: Occasional hairballs are common, but more than once a week needs vet advice. Daily brushing and hairball diets can help.

### Senior Cat Care

**Q: When is a cat a senior?**  
A: Around 11 years old.

**Q: How can I spot arthritis in cats?**  
A: Reduced jumping, overgrown nails (from less scratching), and stiffness after rest. Vets can suggest pain relief and ramps.

### First‑Aid Basics

**Q: What if my cat eats a toxic plant?**  
A: Remove plant bits from the mouth, keep the cat calm, and call the vet with the plant name. Don’t induce vomiting unless told.

# Small Mammals

## Rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus)

### Housing & Diet

A: At least 3 m² combined run and hutch space per rabbit, plus daily free‑running time indoors or in a secure yard.

A: 85 % grass hay, 10 % mixed leafy greens, 5 % pellets. Treats like carrot slices only a few times a week.

### Diet & Health

A: They can’t make vitamin C. Provide fresh bell peppers/greens daily or add a stabilized vitamin C tablet.

**Q: How often should nails be trimmed?**  
A: Every 4–6 weeks to prevent painful splaying.

## Hamsters & Gerbils

### Basics

**Q: Is cotton wool safe for hamster bedding?**

A: No. Mix quality pellets (50–70 %), fresh veggies, and limited seed treats to avoid obesity and vitamin A deficiency.

### Behavior

**Q: Why is my parrot plucking feathers?**  
A: Could be boredom, low humidity, or illness. Increase enrichment and see an avian vet for work‑up.

## End‑of‑Life & Euthanasia

**Q: How do I know when it’s time?**  
A: Quality‑of‑life scales look at pain, appetite, mobility, and joy. When bad days consistently outweigh good, discuss humane euthanasia with your vet.

**Q: Can I be present during euthanasia?**  
A: Yes, most clinics allow it. It’s painless—the pet first receives a calming injection, then a final solution that stops the heart.
